# YOLOv8 Unity 
YOLOv8 Unity integrates cutting-edge and state-of-the-art Deep Learning models with the Unity engine using the Barracuda library. It contains examples of **Object Detection** and **Instance Segmentation**.  
   
This project is the direct continuation of my previous project [YOLO-UnityBarracuda](https://github.com/wojciechp6/YOLO-UnityBarracuda).

## YOLOv8 
[YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of computer vision tasks.    
    
This new version of YOLO achieves better accuracy and is even faster than its predecessors.
